# Next-starter

This repository is meant for begginer developers and serves as a starter to complete frontend challenges with (such as [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges))!
It is based on `create-next-app` with the typescript template, but is configured to work with styled components out of the box. Some some default styles are present in the `globalStyle.ts` file, feel free to modify them. Also I set up `@svgr/webpack` so you can use icons as components, pretty cool.

## How to run

1. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

2. Run in development mode

```bash
yarn dev
```

Enjoy!
